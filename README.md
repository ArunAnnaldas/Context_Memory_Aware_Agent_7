# Context_Memory_Aware_Agent_7
A context-aware Agentic AI system built using LangChain and OpenAI. This project demonstrates how agents can retain conversational memory across multiple prompts using ConversationBufferMemory. The system evolves from simple stateless prompts to multi-turn, memory-rich dialogue, enabling intelligent chaining of logic and code generation.
